# Activity-tracking-ML
A classification problem solution for human activities classifications like sitting, cycling, standing, etc. Performed pre-processing, visualization, transformations and finally applying machine learning algorithms for building models. Multiple models were built and compared for higher accuracy and lower error rate.
